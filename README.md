[AI Is Driving An Evolution In The Role Of The Software Developer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2024/07/09/ai-is-driving-an-evolution-in-the-role-of-the-software-developer/)

## After Reading the article
A lot of concerns are raised recently regarding the increasing power of generative AI on the software development process. Many are worrying that AI would completely take over the jobs of software engineers, but this article provided a interesting insight on how it would become a useful tool for engineers that would allow them to focus on more engaging parts of the work. I agree in this aspect that software engineers would not lose jobs due to AI, but rather would have to evolve around their development process by incorporating AI.

## Comments
I find this article very interesting, espeically with how relevant AI is these days and how the practice can be somewhat controversial. - Lucia Song (lys7942)
